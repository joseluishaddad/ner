# Name Entity Recognition
This model will be trained to recognize these 10 entities:
- INSTRUMENT
- INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER
- MEASUREMENT
- OBJECTIVE
- SUB-OBJECTIVE (not sure yet)
- ORBIT
- STAKEHOLDER
- MISSION
- SPACE_AGENCY
- TECHNOLOGY

For that purpose, a combination of available commands and their possible parameters will be made to create enough data to train the model on this new entities.
